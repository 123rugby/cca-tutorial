# A Tutorial on Canonical Correlation Methods

This repository contains the MATLAB codes applied in [1]. All scripts of the examples are written in a single m file "example_scripts". The scripts of the examples of chapter 2 are all collected in the example_scripts.m in the chapter2_examples folder. The same logic applies in the chapter3_examples folder. The example_scripts.m is divided into sections (by %%) that can be run separately to re-produce the results of the example of the particular section. 

The functions used in the worked examples can also be found in the folder corresponding to the chapter of the tutorial in which the relevant theory was explained.
